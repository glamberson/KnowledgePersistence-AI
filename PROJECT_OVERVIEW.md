# KnowledgePersistence-AI Project Overview

**Created**: 2025-07-02  
**Purpose**: Revolutionary AI Knowledge Persistence System  
**Vision**: Transform AI from replaceable tool to irreplaceable strategic partner  
**Technology**: PostgreSQL + pgvector + on-premises Supabase configuration  

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: AI sessions lose experiential knowledge, working relationship understanding, technical discoveries, and project intuition between sessions, requiring constant rebuilding of capabilities.

**Solution**: Multi-modal database infrastructure with contextual retrieval, relationship mapping, and automated validation systems that preserve all knowledge types across unlimited sessions.

**Breakthrough Opportunity**: Database infrastructure that revolutionizes AI capability persistence for complex project management.

## Technology Architecture

### **Database Stack**
- **PostgreSQL**: Core relational database with ACID compliance
- **pgvector**: Vector database extension for semantic similarity and contextual retrieval
- **Supabase (on-premises)**: Real-time subscriptions, row-level security, REST API
- **Custom Server**: Dedicated on-premises deployment for full control

### **Integration Framework**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Seamless AI integration
- **NavyCMMS Test Source**: Real-world complex project for testing and development
- **Session Continuity**: Automated knowledge loading and validation

### **Knowledge Types Preserved**
1. **Factual Knowledge**: Project status, specifications, documentation
2. **Procedural Knowledge**: Step-by-step processes, technical patterns
3. **Contextual Knowledge**: Decision trails, problem evolution, rationale
4. **Relational Knowledge**: Working relationship patterns, communication dynamics
5. **Experiential Knowledge**: Project intuition, hard-won insights, emotional context
6. **Technical Discovery**: Lessons learned, gotchas, working solutions
