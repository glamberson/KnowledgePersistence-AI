# Implementation Roadmap: Pattern Intelligence System

## Project Summary

**Objective**: Transform KnowledgePersistence-AI from content-focused repository to pattern intelligence system that develops genuine expertise through relationship mapping and multi-LLM processing.

**Key Innovation**: Focus on patterns and relationships between knowledge items rather than raw content storage. This aligns with expertise research - experts recognize patterns and relationships that others miss.

**Technical Strategy**: 
- Local LLMs for pattern extraction and relationship mapping (cost-effective, high-volume)
- Commercial LLMs for strategic reasoning and complex analysis (high-value, targeted)
- Supabase for real-time team collaboration and reduced infrastructure overhead
- PostgreSQL graph operations for relationship storage and traversal
