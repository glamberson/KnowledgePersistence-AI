# GPU + Local LLM Setup: After Action Review
**Date**: 2025-07-03  
**Duration**: ~12 hours across multiple sessions  
**Objective**: Enable local LLM with GPU acceleration on Proxmox VM  
**Result**: âœ… SUCCESS - Ollama + qwen2.5:0.5b running with GPU acceleration  

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully deployed local LLM (Ollama) with NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Proxmox VM after resolving multiple critical issues:
- **Primary Challenge**: Conflicting NVIDIA driver installations (unsigned DKMS + signed Debian packages)
- **Secondary Challenge**: Secure Boot MOK enrollment failures  
- **Resolution**: Clean removal of unsigned modules, proper DKMS rebuild with signed packages
- **Final State**: RTX 4060 with 938MB GPU memory usage during inference

---

## Timeline and Critical Decision Points

### Phase 1: Initial GPU Detection Issues
**Problem**: `nvidia-smi` failing with "couldn't communicate with NVIDIA driver"
**Root Cause**: Conflicting driver installations - both unsigned DKMS and signed Debian packages
**Time Lost**: ~4 hours troubleshooting symptoms instead of root cause

**Critical Learning**: Should have immediately checked for conflicting installations rather than attempting repairs

### Phase 2: Secure Boot and MOK Enrollment
**Problem**: MOK enrollment failing 4+ times with "Required key not available"
**Resolution**: Eventually succeeded on reboot (unclear why previous attempts failed)
**Time Impact**: ~2 hours

**Critical Learning**: Secure Boot troubleshooting requires patient iteration and system reboots

### Phase 3: Module Loading and DKMS
**Problem**: NVIDIA modules not built for current kernel (6.1.0-37-amd64)
**Resolution**: 
1. `sudo dpkg --configure -a` (fixed interrupted package installation)
2. `sudo dkms install nvidia-current/535.247.01` (rebuilt modules)
3. `sudo modprobe nvidia` (loaded modules)

**Critical Success**: Proper systems management approach - fix root issues, don't work around them

### Phase 4: Ollama Installation Issues
**Problem**: Partial/corrupted Ollama installation with wrong permissions
**Resolution**: Complete uninstall and clean reinstall using official script
**Time Impact**: ~1 hour

**Critical Learning**: Always verify clean installation state before troubleshooting

## Technical Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Driver Conflicts
```
PROBLEM: Multiple NVIDIA installations
- Unsigned DKMS modules (535.247.01)  
- Signed Debian packages (535.247.01)
- Modules not loading

RESOLUTION:
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/ollama /usr/local/lib/ollama  # Clean slate
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh           # Clean install
```

### Issue 2: DKMS Module Building
```
PROBLEM: Modules not built for current kernel
SYMPTOM: nvidia-smi fails, lsmod shows no nvidia modules

RESOLUTION:
sudo apt install dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo dkms install nvidia-current/535.247.01
sudo modprobe nvidia nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm
```

### Issue 3: Secure Boot Integration
```
PROBLEM: MOK enrollment failures
SYMPTOM: "Required key not available" during enrollment

RESOLUTION: 
- Patient iteration through MOK enrollment process
- Multiple system reboots until successful
- Signed Debian packages eventually worked with Secure Boot
```

### Issue 4: Ollama Installation State
```
PROBLEM: Corrupted/partial Ollama installation
SYMPTOM: Binary exists but wrong permissions, no systemd service

RESOLUTION:
1. Complete removal of partial installation
2. Fresh installation using official installer
3. Verification of all components (binary, service, user account)
```

## Context Management Analysis

### Critical Context Loss Points

1. **Multi-Session Troubleshooting**: Lost detailed history of what was tried previously
2. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Failed to quickly identify conflicting installations
3. **Sequential Problem Solving**: Started over instead of building on previous discoveries
4. **Root Cause vs Symptom**: Spent time on symptoms rather than investigating fundamentals

### Knowledge Persistence Gaps

1. **Troubleshooting State**: No persistent record of attempted solutions
2. **Error Correlation**: Couldn't connect related errors across sessions  
3. **System State Tracking**: Lost track of what packages/configurations were modified
4. **Decision Rationale**: Previous reasoning for attempts not preserved

---

## Recommended Context Management Improvements

### 1. Troubleshooting Session Persistence
```
NEED: Dedicated troubleshooting log with:
- Attempted solutions and outcomes
- System state before/after changes  
- Error patterns and correlations
- Working theories and eliminated possibilities
```

### 2. Sequential Problem Solving Protocol
```
PROCEDURE: Before starting troubleshooting:
1. Review previous session troubleshooting log
2. Verify current system state vs. expected
3. Identify what changed since last working state
4. Build on previous discoveries, don't restart
```

### 3. Knowledge Persistence Database Integration
```
ENHANCEMENT: Store troubleshooting context in knowledge_persistence DB:
- Technical discoveries and gotchas
- Solution patterns and dependencies  
- System configuration snapshots
- Cross-session learning accumulation
```

### 4. Systematic Diagnostic Approach
```
PROTOCOL:
1. Capture complete system state first
2. Identify all potentially conflicting components
3. Work from fundamental layer up (drivers â†’ modules â†’ applications)
4. Document each change and verification step
```

## Knowledge Persistence System Assessment

### Current State Analysis
The knowledge persistence system exists but wasn't effectively utilized during troubleshooting:

**Available Infrastructure**:
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector
- REST API for knowledge storage/retrieval  
- Session tracking capabilities
- Technical gotchas table

**Usage Gaps**:
- Troubleshooting context not systematically captured
- Cross-session learning not accumulated  
- Error patterns not stored for future reference
- Solution effectiveness not tracked

### Recommended Enhancements

#### 1. Troubleshooting Context Capture
```sql
-- Add troubleshooting session tracking
ALTER TABLE ai_sessions ADD COLUMN troubleshooting_context JSONB;
ALTER TABLE technical_gotchas ADD COLUMN session_id UUID REFERENCES ai_sessions(session_id);
```

#### 2. Automated Context Preservation
- Capture system state snapshots during troubleshooting
- Store error messages and attempted solutions
- Link related problems across sessions
- Build solution effectiveness database

#### 3. Proactive Context Retrieval  
- Check knowledge base for similar problems before starting
- Retrieve previous solutions for identical error messages
- Access related troubleshooting patterns
- Review successful solution sequences

## Success Factors

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Approach**: Eventually adopted proper systems management principles
2. **Clean Installation**: Complete removal and fresh install resolved Ollama issues
3. **Official Resources**: Using official NVIDIA packages and Ollama installer  
4. **Verification Steps**: Confirming each component worked before proceeding
5. **GPU Acceleration Validation**: Proper testing with nvidia-smi monitoring

### Critical Success Principles
1. **Fix Problems, Don't Work Around Them**: Clean uninstall/reinstall vs. patching
2. **Verify System State**: Check for conflicts before assuming single issue
3. **Use Signed/Official Packages**: Reduces Secure Boot and compatibility issues
4. **Sequential Validation**: Test each layer before adding complexity
5. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Confirm GPU utilization during inference
