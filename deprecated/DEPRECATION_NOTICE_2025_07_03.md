# Deprecation Notice - Documentation Consolidation
**Date**: 2025-07-03  
**Reason**: Documentation consolidation to eliminate duplication and maintain single source of truth  

## Files Moved to Deprecated

### GPU_LLM_AFTER_ACTION_REVIEW.md
**Original Purpose**: After action review of GPU/LLM setup process  
**Replacement**: Content merged into `docs/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section 8  
**GitHub Issue**: #2 - Documentation Consolidation  

### CURRENT_CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md  
**Original Purpose**: Audit of MCP, hooks, and tool configurations  
**Replacement**: Content merged into `CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_ANALYSIS.md` and GitHub issues #3, #4, #5  
**GitHub Issue**: #2 - Documentation Consolidation  

## Rationale

These files were created during GPU/LLM troubleshooting without first reviewing existing comprehensive documentation. Following the lessons learned in `FAILURE_ANALYSIS_AND_LEARNING.md`, we consolidated this information into existing documentation to:

1. **Maintain Single Source of Truth**: Avoid documentation fragmentation
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing documentation structure
3. **Improve Discoverability**: Centralize related information
4. **Reduce Maintenance Overhead**: Eliminate duplicate content

## Content Disposition

- **Technical architecture details** → `docs/COMPLETE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section 8: Local LLM Architecture
- **Context management insights** → `CONTEXT_PERSISTENCE_ANALYSIS.md` enhanced troubleshooting section
- **Configuration issues** → GitHub issues #3, #4, #5 for systematic resolution
- **Infrastructure options** → Agnostic deployment options added to main architecture doc

## Access to Original Content

Original files remain available in this deprecated folder for reference but should not be actively maintained. All future updates should go to the consolidated documentation.

**Lesson Applied**: Always review existing documentation before creating new files, as outlined in `FAILURE_ANALYSIS_AND_LEARNING.md` cognitive failure patterns.
