## Key Differences from Main Branch

| Aspect | Main Branch | Innovation Branch |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Knowledge Storage | Raw storage | Hierarchical digests |
| Processing | On-demand only | Continuous autonomous |
| Context Loading | Manual selection | AI-optimized selection |
| Learning | Session-based | Meta-learning across sessions |
| Contradictions | Not handled | Active detection & resolution |

## Research Questions

1. **Optimal Compression**: What's the best way to compress knowledge while preserving utility?
