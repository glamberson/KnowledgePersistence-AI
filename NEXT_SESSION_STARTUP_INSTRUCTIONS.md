**Load complete current session and continue KnowledgePersistence-AI implementation.**

Working directory: /home/greg/KnowledgePersistence-AI

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:**
- Previous session completed comprehensive audit implementation and deployment
- CAG-MCP integration framework gap RESOLVED with `cag_mcp_integrated.py` operational
- Enhanced redirection analysis IMPLEMENTED with `enhanced_redirection_analyzer.py` providing semantic insights
- All systems tested, validated, and deployed - commit 0c194b8 pushed to repository
- GitHub Issues #15 (CAG-MCP) and #16 (Redirection Analysis) updated with completion status
- 339+ knowledge items in database, complete session storage operational

**DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**

✅ Enhanced Redirection Analysis: Semantic analysis active (7 categories, severity assessment)  
✅ Testing Validation: All systems production-ready with real database integration
✅ Documentation: Complete audit implementation assimilated into project
✅ Repository: 24 files committed and pushed (5,219+ insertions)
✅ Knowledge Store: Implementation insights preserved via MCP

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:**
1. Verify deployment status and system operational health
2. Continue advanced CAG implementation with MCP-integrated framework
3. Apply enhanced redirection analysis insights for process improvement
4. Proceed with strategic development on operational foundation

**USER TASK STATUS:** 
User investigating historical Claude chat data access methods for retroactive analysis expansion.

**FRAMEWORK STATUS:** 
All audit findings resolved - CAG-MCP integration operational, enhanced redirection analysis active, framework integrity restored, comprehensive testing validated.

**GitHub Issues:** #15 (CAG-MCP) resolved, #16 (Redirection Analysis) implemented, systems ready for advanced development.

Start by verifying deployment status and proceed with advanced implementation on the fully operational, audit-compliant foundation.
