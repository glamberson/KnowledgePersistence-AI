**Load complete session 0daffdc5-b8f5-4243-bc7a-c6e0fdf4995a and continue KnowledgePersistence-AI implementation.**

Working directory: /home/greg/KnowledgePersistence-AI

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:**
- Previous session implemented complete session storage framework with redirection analysis
- 336 knowledge items in database ready for CAG implementation  
- Session storage system operational: complete_session_storage.py, redirection_analysis_tools.py
- Database: pgdbsrv (192.168.10.90), PostgreSQL with pgvector, 336 knowledge items
- Previous session had 100% redirection rate (2 redirections: qwen-CAG association errors)

**IMMEDIATE TASKS:**
1. Load previous session conversation history from database using session ID 0daffdc5-b8f5-4243-bc7a-c6e0fdf4995a
2. Analyze redirection patterns from previous session (expected: 2 redirections, escalating severity)
3. Begin CAG implementation with systematic knowledge preloading from 336 items
4. Apply lessons from redirection analysis to improve performance (reduce from 100% rate)

**USER TASK STATUS:** 
User investigating historical Claude chat data access methods for retroactive analysis expansion.

**FRAMEWORK STATUS:** 
Complete session storage, redirection analysis, and vector categorization systems operational and ready for advanced implementation.

**GitHub Issues:** #13 completed (session storage), #14 active (next priorities), #8-12 open for continued implementation.

Start by verifying access to the complete previous session data and then continue with CAG implementation priorities.
